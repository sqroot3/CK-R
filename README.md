# CK-R
Programs that I will make over time from the second edition of K&amp;R

# Naming Convention

Each section will have its own directory.
Examples will be prefixed with 'ex', exercises are prefixed with 'e'.
A small description of the program will be appended at the end.

For instance, the first example on chapter 1 section 1 would look like:

{Repo root}/01.01-getting_started/ex-hello.c

# Thanks to
* Creators of K&R's 2nd edition
* Github user 'caisah', adopted his naming conventions.
